# Things I learnt from this activity 
What I learnt from this activity that it's really stressful to make a website because there are so many reasons, for example, 
finding information about the project\subject that your website is about. I also learnt so many new things from the websites that I read.
For example, I learnt the cost, the definition, what it does and where can you find\buy it.

# Things I still want to learn
Some things I still want to learn are there's is not really something that I want to learn anymore because I learnt about everything that
I needed to know.
