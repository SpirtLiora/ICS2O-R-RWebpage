    <em>Here is my project.</em>
 <h1 class="story-title">TinyCore Linux</h1>
 
<p>TinyCore is Linux is a minimal <strong>Linux operating system</strong> focusing on providing
 <br>a base system using <strong>Busybox</strong> and <strong>FLTK</strong>.
<br>TinyCore was developed by <a herf="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/robert_shingledecker.html">Robert Shingledecker.</a>
 <br>The distribution is notable for its small size (11 to 16 MB) and minimalism; additional functions are provided by extensions.
 <br>Tiny Core Linux is free and open source software and is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.

 <h3 class="more-about-tinycore-linux">More about TinyCore Linux</h3>
 <p>"TinyCore" (16 MB) is the recommended option for new users who have a wired network connection. It includes the base Core system and a dynamic FLTK/FLWM graphical user interface.</p>
 
<h3>What is TinyCore built for?</h3>
 <p>Like stated in <a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/">TinyCore's website</a>"Our goal is the creation of a nomadic ultra small graphical desktop operating system capable of booting from cdrom, pendrive, or frugally from a hard drive. The desktop boots extremely fast and is able to support additional applications and hardware of the users choice. While Tiny Core always resides in ram, additional applications extensions can either reside in ram, mounted from a persistent storage device, or installed into a persistent storage device.
</p>
 <h3>Why Would Someone Choose TinyCore?</h3>
    <p>"We invite interested users and developers to explore Tiny Core. Within our forums we have an open developement model. We encourage shared knowledge. We promote community involvement and community built application extensions. Anyone can contribute to our project by packaging their favorite application or hardware support to run in Tiny Core. The Tiny Core Linux Team currently consists of eight members who peruse the forums to assist from answering questions to helping package new extensions." It's also <strong>quick and easy.</strong></p>
